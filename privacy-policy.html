    <h1>Privacy Policy — MusicX</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to MusicX. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data
        when you access and use our mobile application. By using MusicX, you agree to the practices
        described in this document. We are committed to maintaining your trust by protecting your
        privacy and handling your data with transparency.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you sign in using your Google account, we collect your name, email address, and profile
        image (if provided). This information is used solely for identification and personalizing
        your experience in the app. We do not access your contacts, calendar, or any other personal
        content from your Google account.</p>
    <p>We also collect data related to your app activity, such as the songs and podcasts you stream,
        content you favorite, download status, playback behavior, and reward point usage.
        Additionally, we store technical information including your device ID, operating system
        version, and network status to maintain user sessions across devices and troubleshoot
        technical issues.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is used for the following purposes: to log you in through Google authentication,
        enable access to free music and podcasts, manage offline downloads, deduct and award reward
        points, personalize your music recommendations, and synchronize favorites across devices. We
        do not show third-party ads, nor do we sell or rent your personal data to advertisers or
        data brokers.</p>

    <h2>4. Reward Points System</h2>
    <p>New users receive 25 reward points upon account creation. These points can be used to
        download songs for offline use. Each offline download costs 5 points. Once a song is
        downloaded, it remains accessible offline within the app until manually removed. Points are
        securely stored with your profile and are automatically synced when you log in from another
        device.</p>

    <h2>5. Offline Content Management</h2>
    <p>When you download songs offline, they are encrypted and saved locally on your device. These
        files are not accessible by other applications and cannot be shared outside the MusicX
        environment. Offline content is only playable within the app and requires user
        authentication. If your reward point balance is insufficient, the app will restrict further
        offline downloads until additional points are earned.</p>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>MusicX requests certain device permissions for proper functionality. Storage access is
        required to save offline music. Network access is required for streaming and syncing. All
        permissions are requested at runtime with user consent, and we never collect unnecessary or
        excessive permissions. Denying certain permissions may limit the app’s features.</p>

    <h2>7. Account Access and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may access, update, or delete your account at any time. Deleting your account will remove
        all associated data, including your name, email, reward points, favorites, and downloaded
        files. To delete your account, you can either use the option in the app settings (if
        available) or email our support team. Data removal requests are processed within 7 business
        days.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to
        provide you with our services. Once you delete your account or request deletion, your data
        is securely purged from our systems, except where retention is required by law or to resolve
        disputes.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>MusicX uses secure encryption technologies to protect your personal data. Communication
        between your device and our servers is protected with HTTPS. Your offline files are
        encrypted using device-specific keys, ensuring that files cannot be used outside the MusicX
        app environment. We use token-based authentication for login sessions, which expire after a
        period of inactivity.</p>

    <h2>10. International Data Transfer</h2>
    <p>If you access MusicX from outside India, please be aware that your data may be transferred,
        stored, and processed in India or in other countries where our servers or service providers
        are located. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is handled securely and
        in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Compliance</h2>
    <p>MusicX adheres to data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
        for users in the European Union, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for users in
        California, USA. You have the right to request access to your data, correction of
        inaccuracies, and deletion of your data under these regulations.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will
        notify you through the app or via your registered email. The latest version of the Privacy
        Policy will always be available in the app and on our official website.</p>
